# git-gud

This project aims to provide some cool features for a git repository, kinda like Github does.
Additionally the aim is to get used to some new web development tools.

More concrete goals are to:

- [x] Provide syntax hightlighted diffs
- [ ] Provide author statistics
- [ ] Provide an easy search function
- [ ] Provide an interactive way to step through the history of a file (while maintaining syntax highlighting and diff marking)
- [ ] Provide a "home page" that is like a dynamic git log
